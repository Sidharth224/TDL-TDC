# TDL-TDC

This configuration of tapped delay line TDC was highly inspired from the works of this paper https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283355482_New_Design-methodology_of_High-performance_TDC_on_a_Low_Cost_FPGA_Targets
The TDC carry chain design was heavily inspired from this paper https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9585689
The carry chain was implemented on CycloneV board
